Manual Deployment Steps
------------------------

1. Verify that all code has been committed and pushed to GitHub.
2. SSH into the production server using your credentials.
   Command: ssh user@yourserver.com

3. Pull the latest changes from the repo:
   Command: git pull origin main

4. Stop the current running service:
   Command: sudo systemctl stop myapp.service

5. Run setup or migration scripts (if any):
   Command: python setup.py install

6. Start the service again:
   Command: sudo systemctl start myapp.service

7. Check logs for errors:
   Command: tail -f /var/log/myapp.log

8. Validate deployment by accessing the web dashboard.
   URL: http://yourserver.com/dashboard

Notes:
- If anything fails, revert using `git checkout` to the last stable commit.
- Always inform the team once deployment is complete.
